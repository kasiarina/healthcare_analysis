This project focuses on downloading, preprocessing, and performing statistical analysis on ELISA test results and collected data related to IgG and IgM levels, influenza and tuberculosis vaccinations, previous diseases, and blood groups of respondents.

The primary challenge in this project is handling real-world datasets that are often unstructured or presented in a form unsuitable for direct statistical analysis. To address this, I implemented automated preprocessing techniques to clean and structure the data, enabling effective statistical reporting and visualization.

The goal of this project is to gain insights from personal health data collected through surveys and apply modern DataMining techniques for preprocessing and statistical evaluation.
